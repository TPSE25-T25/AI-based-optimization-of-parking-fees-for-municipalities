# AI-based Parking Fee Optimization Prototype

This is a simple prototype application demonstrating AI-based optimization of parking fees for municipalities. The application consists of a React frontend and a Python FastAPI backend. This was generated by CoPilot as a starting point to see how it looks like.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React application with UI components
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI server with RESTful API endpoints
- **Communication**: HTTP requests with CORS enabled for cross-origin communication

## Features

### Backend (FastAPI)
- RESTful API endpoints for parking zone management
- Simple optimization algorithm based on occupancy rates
- CORS middleware for frontend communication
- Pydantic models for data validation
- Sample parking zones with realistic data

### Frontend (React)
- Modern, responsive user interface
- Real-time data visualization
- Interactive fee optimization controls
- Error handling and loading states
- Automatic data refresh functionality

## Prerequisites

### Backend Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Frontend Requirements
- Node.js 14 or higher
- npm package manager

## Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Using the Startup Scripts (Recommended for Windows)

1. **Start the Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   start.bat
   ```
   This will install Python dependencies and start the FastAPI server on `http://localhost:8000`

2. **Start the Frontend (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   start.bat
   ```
   This will install Node.js dependencies and start the React development server on `http://localhost:3000`

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## API Endpoints

The FastAPI backend provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /health` - Detailed health status
- `GET /zones` - Get all parking zones
- `GET /zones/{zone_id}` - Get specific parking zone
- `POST /optimize` - Optimize fee for a specific zone

### Example API Usage

```bash
# Get all parking zones
curl http://localhost:8000/zones

# Optimize fee for zone 1 with target occupancy of 75%
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/optimize" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "zone_id": 1,
       "target_occupancy": 0.75
     }'
```

## Sample Data

The application comes with three sample parking zones:

1. **Downtown** - High-demand area with premium pricing
2. **Shopping District** - Busy commercial area
3. **Residential** - Lower-demand residential zone

## Optimization Algorithm

The current implementation uses a simple optimization algorithm:

- If current occupancy > target occupancy: Increase fee to reduce demand
- If current occupancy < target occupancy: Decrease fee to increase demand

This is a prototype implementation. In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced with more sophisticated AI/ML models considering factors like:
- Time of day patterns
- Seasonal variations
- Local events and activities
- Economic indicators
- Historical demand patterns

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Backend**: Add new endpoints in `backend/main.py`
2. **Frontend**: Add new components in `frontend/src/`

### API Documentation

When the backend is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
# Test the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test getting zones
curl http://localhost:8000/zones
```

### Frontend Testing
The React app includes built-in error handling and will display connection status in the UI.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**: Make sure both servers are running and the frontend is accessing `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Port Conflicts**: 
   - Backend runs on port 8000
   - Frontend runs on port 3000
   - Make sure these ports are available

3. **Dependencies Issues**:
   - For Python: Make sure you're using Python 3.7+
   - For Node.js: Make sure you're using Node.js 14+

4. **Backend Connection Error**:
   - Verify the backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`
   - Check the browser console for detailed error messages

### Logs

- **Backend**: Server logs appear in the terminal where you ran the Python server
- **Frontend**: Development logs appear in the browser console (F12)
